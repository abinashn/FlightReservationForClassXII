# FlightReservationForClassXII
C++ Project Class 12th - for Flight Reservation system

**OBJECTIVE**

The objective of this project is to create an Online Flight Reservation System for National flights operated by different airlines between major cities in India. This project gives an online platform for the customers to book a flight ticket to their choice of destination and dates for travel. 

The “Flight reservation system” project is an attempt to stimulate the basic concepts of airline reservation system. The system enables the customer search for airline flights for two travel cities on a specified date, choose a flight based on the details, reservation of flight and cancellation of reservation.
 
**ENVIRONMENT**

-	Operating System: Windows OS
-	IDE (Development environment): Code::Blocks 17.12
-	C++ Compiler: MinGW's GNU GCC compiler for C++
-	Command Prompt / Output Window Size: 150*30 pixels

**FEATURES**
Welcome to Online Flight Reservation System! 
The major features implemented as a part of this project are:
- Maintenance Platform for Airline Operators / Agents
-	Book a flight ticket
-	Search for flights between cities on a given day

**C++ Concepts Used**

1.	File handling 
2.	Encapsulation
3.  Inheritance 
    - Flight is a base class; 
    - BookFlight is the derived class 
4.	Binary Search 
    - Modify and Delete functions use binary search
    - Add method uses for Duplicate checks at various places
5.	Records are added at sorted position in all data files using Sequential Sort
6.	Pointers (this, object)
7.	Function Overloading
